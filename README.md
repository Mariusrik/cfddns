# cfddns
Simple cloudflare ddns app

pass inn -token [cloudflare api token] -location [zone_id]

This was just a project to test out Kotlin.
I use the project to update dns records on my server as the ip is not static.
As it just works I probably won't clean up the project unless it breaks on api changes. 

No exception/error handling for now.
